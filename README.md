# House-prices-prediction-ANN
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in Python to predict house prices. We preprocess data, select features, train the model with TensorFlow, and integrate it into a user-friendly interface, demonstrating ANN's effectiveness and offering real estate market insights.

Project Description:
House Prices Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
In this project, we focus on predicting house prices using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) implemented in Python with the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) framework. The primary goal is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

Key Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses.
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features for better model performance.
Feature Engineering:

Select relevant features that significantly impact house prices.
Create new features if necessary to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Development:

Design and implement an ANN using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).
Experiment with different network architectures, activation functions, and optimization algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Train the ANN model on the training set and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Evaluate the model using the testing set and relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error).
Deployment and Integration:

Deploy the trained model for practical use, enabling users to input house features and receive price predictions.
Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface, potentially using AIML for conversational interactions.
Performance Analysis and Optimization:

Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
Implement optimization techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and ensemble methods to enhance the model's robustness.
Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language for data handling, model development, and implementation.
AIML: Framework for developing conversational AI to potentially enhance user interaction.
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras for building and training the ANN; Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation; Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
Expected Outcomes:
A highly accurate predictive model for house prices using ANN.
Insights into the key features affecting house prices.
A user-friendly interface for practical deployment of the prediction model.
This project demonstrates the application of ANN in real-world scenarios, highlighting the power of machine learning in predictive analytics and offering valuable insights into the real estate market.
